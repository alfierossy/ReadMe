Hello and welcome to my GitHub page!
My name is Fred and I'm a Research Analyst from KANTAR and a student at Turing College. I'm passionate about strategy, finding insights, telling stories and solving problems with data.
In this page, you can find some of the projects that I have done or contributed to, showcasing my skills and interests in data analytics. You can also check out my LinkedIn Profile for more details about me and my work.
• CLV analysis project: This project aims to estimate the customer lifetime value (CLV) of an online retail company’s customer, based on their purchase history and behaviour. CLV is a metric that measures how much a customer is worth to a business over their entire relationship. By calculating the CLV, the company can identify its most valuable customers, segment them into different groups, and design targeted marketing strategies to increase retention and loyalty.
• Logistic and multiple regression analysis: Logistic regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a binary outcome variable (such as purchase or not) and one or more predictor variables (such as age, gender, income, etc.). Multiple regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a continuous outcome variable (such as CLV) and one or more predictor variables. Both methods can be used to test hypotheses, estimate coefficients, and make predictions based on the data.
• Cohort analysis: Cohort analysis is a technique that groups customers into cohorts based on a common characteristic or event (such as signup date, first purchase date, etc.) and tracks their behaviour over time. Cohort analysis can help understand how different cohorts differ in terms of retention, churn, revenue, etc. and identify factors that influence customer behaviour.
• RFM analysis is a technique that segments customers based on three metrics: recency, frequency, and monetary value. Recency measures how recently a customer made a purchase, frequency measures how often a customer made a purchase, and monetary value measures how much a customer spent. By assigning scores to each metric and combining them, RFM analysis can rank customers into different segments, such as loyal, high-value, at-risk, etc. RFM analysis can help optimize marketing campaigns, increase customer loyalty, and improve customer lifetime value.
